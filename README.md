# 📊 Binary Options Candle Pattern Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project tests and analyzes a specific **candlestick pattern** designed for **binary options trading**.  

> ⚡ **Strategy designed by me**, originally implemented in **LUA**, the scripting language used for custom indicators in IQ Option.  

Historical market data for backtesting was **extracted using MetaTrader 5**. The Python backtesting script evaluates the pattern’s effectiveness, providing insights for data-driven trading decisions.

## 🔹 Strategy Logic
The pattern works as follows:

1. **Bullish Setup**:
   - Candle[i] closes **above the high of Candle[i-1]**.
   - The **body of Candle[i]** is larger than each of its wicks individually.
   - Enter a **long position on Candle[i+1]** if, within the first **30 seconds**, the price surpasses `open[i]`.
   - **Expiration** is set at the **close of Candle[i+1]**.

2. **Bearish Setup**:
   - Candle[i] closes **below the low of Candle[i-1]**.
   - The **body of Candle[i]** is larger than each of its wicks individually.
   - Enter a **short position on Candle[i+1]** if, within the first **30 seconds**, the price drops below `open[i]`.
   - **Expiration** is set at the **close of Candle[i+1]**.

> This logic is implemented in **LUA** for IQ Option, and reproduced in Python for backtesting.
